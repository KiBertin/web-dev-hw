1. Each page can only have one element each of head and body per document. The head element provides the browser information about the document itself, such as the title of the page, the page's author, when it was published, etc. The body, on the other hand, is where the actual rendered data of the page resides. The content of the body element is what is displayed on the viewing user's computer.
2. The key difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural markup embeds information itself into the document, while semantic markup reinforces the meaning of that information.
3. For this assignment, I tended to jump around a bit rather than going step-by-step. I focused on making each of the headings, embedded images and hyperlinks clean and functional before I incorporated the information underneath each of the headings. During that time, I really struggled with getting the HTML link for the image to work on the browser preview - I finally realized it was because I had the "/" incorporated in front of the images file in the pathway. After I got rid of that, it displayed properly. Once I made sure everything in the index file worked properly, I finished my responses in the README.
