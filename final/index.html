      <br />
      <p>Overwatch is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter in which two teams of six go head to head. Each player selects a “hero” from a roster of over 30 characters, each of which has unique skill sets and abilities that fit within a general team role: tank, damage, or support. When looking to improve as a team, you must ask yourself how each player contributes to the team's cohesion as a whole, and what improvements are required.</p>
