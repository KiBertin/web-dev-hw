      <h1>Live Team Coaching</h1>
        <p>Many other coaches only offer vod reviews or one-on-one sessions. I firmly believe that the best way to understand how a team works together and what is necessary to help them improve the most is by working with the team as a whole in a competitive setting. I will tune in during your practices, take note of your communication and team dynamics, and focus on both individual and team-based changes that can be made to best improve your gameplay.</p>
      <h1>Vod Reviews</h1>
        <p>Vod reviews are the core of improvement for Overwatch. The main issue is that the typical player doesn't understand what it is they are looking for within these recordings. That's where I come in - I have several years of experience of reviewing gameplay, giving me a unique perspective on why certain teamfights went the way they did, and what weaknesses are causing each player's performance to suffer.</p>
      <h1>Conflict Management</h1>
        <p>If you've ever lived with roommates, you know that conflict between people is inevitable. Often, unresolved conflict between players is the primary reason for teams falling apart. As a coach, I offer not only gameplay improvement, but my skills as a mediary to help settle any internal conflict on a team. By being able to calmly and safely address this conflict, I can help maximize the improvement of your team's synergy.</p>
