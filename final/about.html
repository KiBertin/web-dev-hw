      <h2><b>Kian "keydei" Bertin</b></h2>
      <p>Hello there! I am keydei, a longtime player and coach for Overwatch. I have over five years of experience of teamleading and coaching, with my most notable role being the head coach of the University of Montana's varsity and junior varsity Overwatch teams.</p>
      <p>During my time as a coach, I have seen my players go from being unskilled and uncoordinated in a team setting to becoming the closest of friends and working together without prompting, taking down teams several degrees higher in individual skill through sheer synergy.</p>
      <p>My primary strengths as a coach is understanding of teamfight dynamics, positioning, team communication, and thorough understanding of what makes my players tick. By understanding my players, I can more effectively guide them maximize their greatest strengths and have their teammates cover their weaknesses without issue.</p>
      <p>Have you been finding your team in a rut where you know that you have the potential to improve, but aren't sure where to start? I am completly confident that my services will help push you to the next level. Send me a message to book an appointment today!</p>
