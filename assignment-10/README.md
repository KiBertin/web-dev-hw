1. System fonts are fonts already installed on a user's local device and system. While readily accessible to the user's applications, they might not be as accessible on the web. Web fonts, on the other hand, are custom fonts hosted on a server rather than on the user's device, and are rendered when loading the web page. Finally, web-safe fonts are font families that almost every device would have, such as Arial, Times New Roman, etc.
2. Not having a fallback font or a font stack can lead to having a webpage not display as a designer intended, which can lead to poor user experience with a webpage.
3. With this assignment, I started by figuring out what reading excerpt I should use, and then deciding what the best web page aesthetic would work for that. I then researched font pairings that work well from Google Fonts, and then downloaded those font families. After that, I tinkered around with the kerning, spacing, and layout of the webpage until I found it satisfactory. Designing the button was a little tricky at first, and had to take some inspiration from the example webpage to make it function properly.
