        <p>After an hour's hard riding under a gelid moon, the party arrived at a sumptuous villa on a bare hill overlooking Aquae Sulis proper. Although no lights shone, the brick and stone of the buildings seemed to be away and eerily sentient. In those dark hours preceding the dawn, the villa appeared to crouch like a jeweled toad on the spine of the hill, causing Artorex to suppress a superstitious shudder.</p>
        <p>The floor plans of Roman villas, despite their thick walls, usually followed the natural variations of the terrain so that they blended with their surroundings. With their orchards, gardens, and running water, Roman homes were graceful and comfortable places.</p>
        <p>But the Villa Severinii was unlike any Roman palace that Artorex had ever seen. The hill was bare of all vegetation, and no sculptures were visible along the walls to soften the harshness of the bare stone. The structure hadn't been whitewashed, as was the normal custome; Severinus had ordered that a dark red ochre should be mixed with a skim of mortar, which might have been fashionable in old Pompeii but transplanted into Aquae Sulis gave the impression that the villa had been dipped in drying blood.</p>
        <p>Boldly, but on silent feet, five grim men led their horses up to the stables. Th silence was tomblike, and the air seemed unnaturally prescient. Not a soul was stirring in the villa, not even an ostler. The horses rolled their eyes, sensing something unwholesome in the air, and Artorex was suddenly grateful that he had not come alone.</p>
        <p>The humid weather conditions conspired to suffocate the intruders. It was the kind of warmth that rarely came to the north, but, when it did, it left the weak or the very old short of breath and close to death. Within their light armor, the friends sweated profusely, even in these early hours of the morning when the cooler breezes should have brought some relief.</p>
        <p><i>Perhaps the earth itself is sickening here,</i> Artorex thought as he wiped away the sweat that streamed down his face.</p>
        <p>The gate at the entrance to the villa had been left unlatched, perhaps in anticipation of the arrival of Caius. A drowsy steward intercepted the armed men as they entered the atrium, his eyes flaring in sudden panic. He would have run to raise the alarm had pen Bryn not picked him up bodily from behind, clamped one hand over his mouth, and expertly snapped his neck.</p>
        <p>“The servant could have been innocent,” Artorex protested.</p>
        <p>“Not if he lived in this pestilence,” Llanwith whispered. “Smell the air, my young friend. <strong>The corruption of death hangs over this villa.</strong>”</p>
