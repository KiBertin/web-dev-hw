      Because I could not stop for Death –
      He kindly stopped for me –
      The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
      And Immortality.

      We slowly drove – He knew no haste
      And I had put away
      My labor and my leisure too,
      For His Civility –

      We passed the School, where Children strove
      At Recess – in the Ring –
      We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
      We passed the Setting Sun –

      Or rather – He passed Us –
      The Dews drew quivering and Chill –
      For only Gossamer, my Gown –
      My Tippet – only Tulle –

      We paused before a House that seemed
      A Swelling of the Ground –
      The Roof was scarcely visible –
      The Cornice – in the Ground –

      Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet
      Feels shorter than the Day
      I first surmised the Horses' Heads
      Were toward Eternity –
