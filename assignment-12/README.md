1. My imaginary client was Chad Jameson, a personal trainer who was wanting a website that put together both a fitness blog and offering his personal training services all in one.

2. Display: inline displays the element on the same line. They will only take the same width as its content, and setting width and height doesn't affect the display. Inline-block is similar to inline, but also allows you to set height and width values. Finally, block starts on a new line and is the full width of its parent element.

3. This project actually was a lot simpler than the last one. You see, I actually planned assignment-11 so that I could use the majority of that HTML and CSS code to design this assignment's webpages. All I had to do after that was work on creating a contact form, incorporate images, and customize the page so that it fit the aesthetic of my imaginary client better. While it may not be perfect, it's the best I can do considering the timeline of this semester.
