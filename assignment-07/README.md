1.Divs are the overarching classification, allowing developers to group other elements together. Classes serve as an identifier for HTML elements, putting together groups of similar types of elements using the same name value. Ids are similar to classes that they serve as an identifier, but ids are more unique for each element. Spans, finally, groups content together when those elements require organization or extra styling. One example the website gives is using the span element to identify text that need to set itself apart on the HTML page.
2.Alt text is text that appears on a page if a video or image fails to load. This allows tools used by visually impaired readers describe the image or video, and helps with search engine optimization.
3.This project was fairly fun. Finding the proper content and figuring out how to embed and format the code correctly was an interesting endeavor. The part I struggled the most with, however, was at the very end with embedding the Google Maps location of UM. I spent a couple hours trying to figure out why the embedded code wasn't rendering on the page before trying out making it in its own separate div, which ended up being the answer needed to render the embedded map.
