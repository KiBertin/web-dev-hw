      <p>Welcome to this instructable on how to create a character on DndBeyond! Since you are here, I'm assuming you are new to creating a character. Have no fear!
        This instructable will take you step by step through everything you'll need to do to get rolling (get it?) into your first session. The ruleset we'll be using
        for this character creation is D&D's 5th edition.

      <ol style="text-align:left;">
        <li> <b>Starting Options:</b> On the first page of DndBeyond, it will have you generate a character name and any preferences for making the character. Stick with the standard options already chosen. Click the right arrow.</li>
        <li> <b>Choose a race.</b> The basic races and associated racial traits are on a table if you wish to see all of the options together. Once you've made a decision, click on the race you wish your character to be and click the right arrow.
          <img src="./images/step-02.png" alt="example of race options using a half-orc" title="Race Options" width="480px"></li>
        <li> <b>Choose a class.</b> This will determine what abilities your character can perform and what benefits they receive. Once you've decided on a class and chosen your class-specific proficiencies, click the right arrow.
          <img src="./images/step-03.png" alt="list of available classes on DndBeyond" title="Class Options" height="480px"></li>
        <li> <b>Determine Ability Scores.</b> There are several methods that can be used to generate ability scores. For simplicity's sake, choose the Standard Array, which gives you the numbers 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to assign to your character's ability scores.
            If you are not certain what each ability score does, DndBeyond can give more detail. Once you have assigned your ability scores, click the right arrow.</li>
        <li> <b>Flesh out your character.</b> Here, you will choose your character's background, their physical and personal characteristics, and any notes on your character's backstory that you might have. Once you've finished detailing your character, click the right arrow.</li>
        <li> <b>Choose your starting equipment.</b> Click on the "starting equipment" heading and select the "equipment" option. Here, there will be options for your class's standard starting equipment set. Once you've chosen what items you want for your starting equipment, click the right arrow.</li>
        <li> <b>Congratulations!</b> You have completed the process of making a character on DndBeyond. Now you just need to export the character sheet, and you'll be set to play a game. Have fun!
