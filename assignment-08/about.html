      <p>This instructable, although a very basic form of the overall process of making a character, is very important to me.
          I grew up playing Dungeons & Dragons with my family ever since I learned how to read and write, but making a character was never very easy until websites such as DndBeyond came around.
          Before DndBeyond and similar websites, the best automated character creation system you could use required programming in Excel. So, I figured I'd share a bit of my passion by making this instructable
          explaining the basics of using DndBeyond. There is substantially more customization options and content not mentioned in the instructable. If you would like to know more, I highly recommend making
          an account at dndbeyond.com and exploring everything they have to offer.</p>
