1. I had almost no experience handling websites before entering this class, other than using one of the website design pages such as Wix. Because of this, almost everything was new and fascinating to me. The most difficult thing I had to deal with when learning HTML, I think, was handling the formatting and keeping the coding clean.
2. I'm excited to incorporate CSS because it opens up several more avenues of creativity. The thing I am most anxious about, however, is adding on another layer of coding complexity to my projects and making sure I can complete it all in the time I have remaining.
3. This assignment took me the longest out of any of them. The longest part, however, was just figuring out what the heck to make my instructable about. I couldn't think of anything until my wife finally suggested what this instructable came to be. I looked up website color palettes to find something that fit the aesthetic of the content I made, then worked on cleaning up the code so it looked good. For the images, I took screenshots of me working through making a character on DndBeyond.
